[Altitude QNH]
This is the height above mean sea level reported by the GPS or by the Baro sensor (if pressure altitude is available and if it is selected to be used). 
It is the altitude really used internally for all calculations. GPS altitude and Baro altitude infoboxes are available too; one of those two values is used in the QNH altitude. 
USE THIS ALTITUDE as main reference, since this is the one being used by LK8000.
Touchscreen/PC only: in simulation mode, this value is adjustable with the up/down arrow keys and the right/left arrow keys also cause the glider to turn.

@1
[Altitude AGL
This is the navigation altitude minus the terrain height obtained from the terrain file.  The value is coloured red when the glider is below the terrain safety clearance height.

@2
[Thermal last 30 sec]
Climb rate during last 30 seconds, based of the reported GPS altitude, or vario if available.

@3
[Bearing]
True bearing of the next waypoint.  For AAT tasks, this is the true bearing to the target within the AAT sector.

@4
[L/D 20\" ]
Instantaneous glide ratio, given by the ground speed divided by the vertical speed (GPS speed) over the last 20 seconds.  Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the vertical speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.

@5
[L/D Th]
The distance from the top of the last thermal, divided by the altitude lost since the top of the last thermal.  
Negative values indicate climbing cruise (height gain since leaving the last thermal).  
If the vertical speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.
Attention: doing zig zag or turning back will result in wrong values! Use L/D Average instead.

In cruise flight mode, this speed-to-fly is calculated for maintaining altitude.  
In final glide mode, this speed-to-fly is calculated for descent.  
In climb mode, this switches to the speed for minimum sink at the current load factor (if an accelerometer is connected).

@44
[Netto Vario]
Instantaneous vertical speed of air-mass, equal to vario value less the glider's estimated sink rate.  
Best used if airspeed, accelerometers and vario are connected, otherwise calculations are based on GPS measurements and wind estimates.

[Task Arrival Time]
Estimated arrival local time at task completion, assuming performance of ideal MacCready cruise/climb cycle.

@46
[Next Arrival Time]
Estimated arrival local time at next waypoint, assuming performance of ideal MacCready cruise/climb cycle.

@47
[Bearing Difference]
The difference between the glider's track bearing, to the bearing of the next waypoint, or for AAT tasks, to the bearing to the target within the AAT sector.  
GPS navigation is based on the track bearing across the ground, and this track bearing may differ from the glider's heading when there is wind present.  
Chevrons point to the direction the glider needs to alter course to correct the bearing difference, that is, so that the glider's course made good is pointing directly at the next waypoint.  
This bearing takes into account the curvature of the Earth.

@48
[Outside Air Temperature]
Outside air temperature measured by a probe if supported by a connected intelligent variometer.

@49

Efficiency required to the arrival height above the final waypoint. Classic value to use!

@67
@68
[Alternate efficiency]
Glide ratio to the arrival height above the selected alternate waypoint.  This is not adjusted for total energy.
Over 200 nothing is shown, between 100 and 200 an integer number is shown, between 1 and 99 a decimal value is shown.

@69
[BestAlternate]
Automatic search for the best landing option available.

@70
[QFE]
Automatic QFE. This altitude value is using GPS altitude or Barometric Altitude if available and if selected, and it is constantly reset to 0 on ground BEFORE taking off. 
After takeoff, it is no more reset automatically even if on ground. 
Changing QFE does not affect QNH altitudes. QFE is NOT used for calculations, it is only as a reference for the pilot.

@71
[Average efficiency]
The distance made in the configured period of time , divided by the altitude lost since then.  
Negative values are shown as oo (infin) and indicate climbing cruise (height gain). Over 200 of LD the value is shown as oo .
You can configure the period of averaging in the Special config menu. 
Suggested values for this configuration are 60, 90 or 120: lower values will be closed to Instant efficiency, and higher values will be closed to Efficiency from last thermal.
Notice that the distance is NOT the straight line between you old and current position: it's exactly the distance you have made even in a zigzag glide.
This value is not calculated while circling. 

@72
[Next Efficiency required]
The required glide ratio to reach the next waypoint, given by the distance to next waypoint divided by the height required to arrive at the SAFETY ARRIVAL ALTITUDE.
Over 199 and below 1 , no value is shown.
This is a pure geometric calculation, equal to Garmin, Naviter and most of common other instruments.

@73
[Flight Level]
Altitude Flight Level indicator. FL is expressed in hundreds of feets. 
This indicator uses current altitude which is NOT necessarily barometric, and in any case non necessarily calculated on the standard atmosphere.
In other words, it is not accurate and can be wrong even of some hundreds feet!
So use it as an approximated indicator.
Caution, no warranty!

@74
[Task Distance Covered]
Distance covered up to now, from the current task. You need a valid start to make it account!

@75
[Alternate arrival]

@76
[Alternate arrival]
Arrival altitude difference over alternate. Press ENTER or RETURN after selecting the infobox in order to pull up its relative waypoint menu.

@77
[Alternate arrival]
Arrival altitude difference over alternate. Press ENTER or RETURN after selecting the infobox in order to pull up its relative waypoint menu.

@78
[Home Radial]

@79
[Airspace Distance]
CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE. Distance to the nearest Airspace. Even if airspace is not appearing on the map, disabled or acknowldged already, distance remains. 
If 0, you are inside an airspace, use Nearest Airspace menu to know more about it.

@83
[Odometer]
The distance made since TAKEOFF, calculated each second, also while circling. This value is reset to zero at Take Off, and cannot be reset in any other way. This value is calculated just like if you were driving a car on a flat surface!

@84
[Altern QNH]
QNH altitude with units inverted: if you are using meters, than it will be in feet, if you are using feet than it will be in meters. 

@85
[Altern AltAGL]
Altitude above ground level with units inverted: if you are using meters, than it will be in feet, if you are using feet than it will be in meters. 

@86
[GPS Altitude]
This is the altitude reported from the GPS. Depending on your GPS device it can be quite accurate or very wrong sometimes. 
Expecially if you are using a car navigator gps, the reported altitude can be very wrong during thermalling. 
If you have no Baro Altitude available, or you havent selected it inside config menu 5, then this GPS altitude is going to be used internally for all calculations. 
QNH altitude can use either GPS or Baro altitude. 
Normally you should use as main infobox the QNH altitude, because it will always tell you what is being used internally.

@87
[MacCready Equivalent]
This is the current real McCready you are using based on current average air speed. This value cannot be changed, and it is averaged on the same amount of time of AverageLD. 
If you have no AirSpeed probe, Estimated Airspeed will be used. See the manual for more informations.
