@100
Sets the level of detail of the configuration settings.
[Basic]: Only basic settings are shown.
[Expert]: Basic and advanced settings are shown.

@101
The name of the file containing TOPOLOGY, and only optionally also terrain, waypoints, airspaces. 
The .LKM is really a ZIP file, renamed. If you change suffix to ZIP you can open it and change contents.
Map files are located inside the _Maps subfolder.

@102
The name of the file containing digital elevation terrain data, normally a .DEM file. 
Also .DAT and .JP2 files are valid. 
Remember that terrain could also be loaded internally from LKM map files. 
In this case terrain chosen here ovverrides the one preconfigured in LKM.
This file is inside _Maps subfolder. 

@103
Primary waypoints file.  Waypoint files are located inside _Waypoints subfolder.
You can use Winpilot DAT files, SeeYou CUP files, COMPEgps WPT files.
ATTENTION: when you create a NEW waypoint, it will be saved inside file 1, with the corresponding format.

@104
Secondary waypoints file.  Waypoint files are located inside _Waypoints subfolder.
You can use Winpilot .DAT files, SeeYou .CUP files, or COMPEgps .wpt files.

@105
The file name of the primary airspace file.
Airspace files are located inside _Airspaces subfolder.

@106
The file name of the secondary airspace file.

@107
For each airfield, you can add additional informations inside this file located in _Waypoints subdirectory.
Here you can change this default file name to something else.

@108
Controls filtering of airspace for display and warnings.  The airspace filter button also allows filtering of display and warnings independently for each airspace class.
[All on] All is displayed.
[Clip] Only airspace below the clip altitude.
[Auto] All within a margin of the glider.
[All below] All airspace below the glider.

@109
For clip airspace mode, this is the altitude below which airspace is displayed.

@110
For auto airspace mode, this is the altitude above/below which airspace is included.

@111
Enable/disable all airspace warnings.

@112
This is the time before an airspace incursion is estimated at which the system will warn the pilot.

@113
This is the time period in which an acknowledged airspace warning will not be repeated.

@114
Draw a black outline around each airspace rather than the airspace color

@115
Draws digital elevation terrain on the map.
This is shaded by the wind direction: upwind is brighter, downwind darker.

@116
Draw topological features (roads, rivers, lakes etc) on the map.  Requires the topology file to be specified.

@117
Defines the amount of phong shading in the terrain rendering.  Use large values to emphasise terrain slope, 
smaller values if flying in steep mountains.

@118
Defines the brightness (whiteness) of the terrain rendering.  This controls the average illumination of the terrain.

@119
Defines the color ramp used in terrain rendering.

@120
Enable or disable moving map shade effect.

@121
If NO TERRAIN is used, this is the color to be used as a background. Note that some colors are suitable for no topology use, 
other are suitable for topology, etc. 

@122
Set a limit to how many labels, including topology, landables and waypoints, can be printed on the map.
The decluttering engine is already taking care not to overlap labels. This setting is useful to speed up map display when 
you have a huge number of topology and waypoints and a slow CPU device. Normally you can leave it to the default value, 70.

@123
Determines how labels are displayed with each waypoint:
[Names] The full name of each waypoint is displayed.
[Numbers] The waypoint number of each waypoint is displayed.
[None] No names are displayed with the waypoints.
[Names in task] Names are only displayed for waypoints that are in the active task as well as the home airfield.
[First Three] The first 3 letters of the waypoint name are displayed.
[First Five] The first 5 letters of the waypoint name are displayed.

@124
Determines whether and how long a snail trail is drawn behind the glider

@125
Determines how the screen is rotated with the glider:
[North up] The moving map display will always be orientated north to south and the glider icon will be rotated to show its course.
[North smart] is like North up, but the glider icon is repositioned automatically to make more space for map forward.
This modality works only in landscape mode. For portrait mode, it is identical to North Up. In North Smart it is not possible
to reposition the glider manually from menu buttons.
[Track up] The moving map display will be rotated so the glider's track is oriented up.
[North up when circling] Track-up in cruise and north-up when circling.
[Target up when circling] Track-up in cruise and the bearing to next waypoint up when circling.
[North/track] North-up in cruise, glider track-track up in circling

@126
When zoom level is greater or equal to this value, map orientation will change to NorthUp. 
If below this value, the Orientation setting will be used normally. 
Setting an high value will result in never using this option. Default is 10.

@127
Auto-zoom changes the zoom level during flight so that the map zooms in as the active waypoint is approached.  
After passing a waypoint, the map zooms out to the next waypoint.
Manually changing the zoom will disable Auto zoom.

@128
Determines whether the snail trail is drifted with the wind when displayed in circling mode.

@129
Sets the width of the snail trail display.

@130
If enabled, then the map will zoom in automatically when entering circling mode and zoom out automatically when leaving circling mode.

@131
Waypoints labels have priority over topology labels, so many waypoints on the map will deny topology labels to appear. 
Here you can define how much you want wp labels closed to each other, using the LK8000 decluttering engine.
DISABLE will show all waypoints on the map also overlapping each other,
LOW will not show overlapping waypoint names but will fill up the map as much as possible,
MEDIUM and HIGH will leave more space between waypoint labels, leaving more space for topology labels,
VERY HIGH will separate wp labels a lot, almost giving priority to topology labels.

@132
DISABLE will show informations for all reachable and landable waypoints which are visible on the map, 
LOW will not show outlandings if there are better airports available, 
HIGH will try to avoid showing airports close to other better airfields.


@133
The height above terrain that the glider should arrive at for a safe landing. Do NOT let it zero! A good value is 300m

@134
Apply safety altitude to landing points only, or also to turnpoints. If only to landables, then arrival altitude over turnpoints will NOT consider any extra margin.
[Landables only] add extra altitude to landables only. This is the default.
[Landables and turnpoints] Apply extra altitude for all waypoints.">

@135
The height above terrain that the glider must clear during final glide, and to pass obstacles. A good value is 50m

@136
The MacCready setting used for determining arrival altitude at airfields. A good value is 0.5ms

@137
If landable waypoints are available, BestAlternate will warn you when you are loosing any reachable landing place, 
and when your best alternate option is changing. Warnings will not happen below a critical altitude, in order not to disturb you.

@138
This determines whether the configuration settings dialog is accessible during flight. 

@139
This allows switching on or off the automatic wind algorithm.  When the algorithm is switched off, 
the pilot is responsible for setting the wind estimate.
[Circling] Requires only a GPS source
[ZigZag] requires an intelligent vario with airspeed output.
[Both] Use ZigZag and circling.

@140
This is the INDICATED AIR SPEED to hold in straight flight before asking for TrueWind calculation. 
Keep heading to NSWE looking at your compass, and keep this speed on your anemometer for some seconds, 
then press the dedicated TrustWind button. Since you don't have an air probe to tell LK8000 what is your Indicated Air Speed, 
LK will assume you will be using this value.
IF YOU DO HAVE an airspeed probe, this value is NOT used since the wind is automatically calculated using that IAS.
Minimum speed is 5 knots or 10 kmh, default is 100kmh or 54 knots. 

@141
To calculate the wind during straight flight, you must bear heading and speed for some seconds. 
Decide for how many seconds you need to keep steady values. Default is 10 seconds. 
Longer time is hard to deal with. Shorter times are more easy to achieve, but may give more inaccurate results below 10 seconds.
There is a tolerance of 30% relative to this parameter. 

@142
This option defines which auto MacCready algorithm is used.
[Final glide] adjusts Mc for fastest arrival.  For OLC sprint tasks,
 the MacCready is adjusted in order to cover the greatest distance in the remaining time and reach the finish height.
[Average] sets Mc to the average climb rate across all climbs.
[Both] Uses average during task, then fastest arrival when in final glide mode.
[Equivalent MC] Use MC calculated on your current average speed. See the manual. 

@143
Average efficiency is always calculated in REAL TIME. Here you can decide on how many seconds of flight this calculation must be done.
The real distance covered second by second in this period is divided by the final difference of altitude.
So if for example you go and return back to the same point after 2 minutes, and you have set 2 minutes as period, 
averageLD will consider the total distance covered in those two minutes , 
and NOT the distance between your position 2 minutes before and your current position, that in this case could be almost zero! 
Normally for gliders a good value is 90-120 seconds, and for paragliders 15 seconds. 
Lower values will give as a result pretty much the same as LD Instant , 
while higher values will look like LD Cruise. Other commercial instruments and software use 2 minutes. 

@144
The estimate of the center of lift is displayed when in circling mode.
[OFF] Thermal center locator disabled.
[Mark center]  A thermal marker is displayed at the center of lift.
[Pan to center] A marker is displayed at the center of lift,
 and when circling, the display is panned to this lift center.

@145
When enabled and the Thermal Locator is also active, a sound tone will be played while circling when 
it is time to reduce the turn rate and go straight a bit.

@146
This option enables automatic forcing of final glide mode if the aircraft is above final glide prior to reaching the penultimate 
waypoint.  Forcing final glide early can also be performed manually from the task menu.

@147
When enabled and if connected to a barometric altimeter, barometric altitude is used for all navigation functions. 
Otherwise GPS altitude is used.


@148
This contains a selection of gliders of different performance classes, as well as a special entry for WinPilot custom File.

@149
When WinPilot File is the polar type, this is the name of the file containing the glide polar data.
Polars must be placed inside _Polars subfolder.

@150
The maximum manoeuvring speed can be entered on this page to prevent the glide computer from commanding unrealistic cruise speeds.

@151
The handicap factor used for OnLine Contest scoring.

@152
The time in seconds to dump FULL ballast.

@153
Type of primary device. The primary device should be the most reliable GPS data source.

@154
Internal COM port

@155
Port speed

@156
Bit format, normally 8

@157
Type of secondary device.
The secondary device may be used as backup GPS data or other data e.g. from an intelligent variometer.
Generic can be used for GPS sources including FLARM.

@158
Geoid altitude correction applies only to GPS altitude, not to barometric altitude. If you have barometric altitude and you chose
to use it, this parameter is not so important.
If you don't have a baro altitude available, then you should check that the GPS input is already compensated for Geoid separation or not.
If the altitude on ground is 30 to 50m constantly wrong, you should either enable or disable this setting. If in doubt, leave it enabled.
Some GPS already compensate for geoid separation.
Condor simulator need this setting OFF.
Default is ON.

@159
Adjust GPS altitude with a fixed offset. Be careful with this setting: your offset will modify gps height permanently during the flight!
Before changing this value, check that the Geoid altitude separation is applied correctly. Default value is 0.
This value IS saved to the registry!

@160
If you experience connection slowdown with your GPS device, or intermittent breaks, try setting Polling mode.
Default is Normal, and for PC this choice has no effect. 

@161
Enabled by default, set Disabled to ignore NMEA errors and keep using the data.

@162
Maximum speed allowed in start observation zone.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@163
Maximum speed to above maximum start speed to tolerate.  Set to 0 for no tolerance.

@164
Maximum height above ground while starting the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@165
Maximum height above maximum start height to tolerate.  Set to 0 for no tolerance.

@166
Reference used for start max height rule
[MSL] Reference is altitude above mean sea level
[AGL] Reference is the height above the start point

@167
Minimum height above ground while finishing the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@168
If enabled, this option requires the minimum height above ground for finish to be greater than 1000m below the start height.

@169
Rules used for calculating optimal points for OnLine Contest.
[Sprint]: Conforms to FAI IGC League rules.  Up to 5 points including start and finish, maximum duration 2.5 hours, 
finish height must not be below start height.
[Triangle]: Conforms to FAI OLC triangle rules.  Four points with common start and finish.  
For tasks longer than 500km, no leg less than 25% or larger than 45%; otherwise no leg less than 28% of total. 
Finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.
[Classic]: Conforms to OLC classic rules.  Up to seven points including start and finish, finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.  Points awarded 80% on second last leg and 60% on last leg.

@170
Units used for airspeed and ground speed.  A separate unit is available for task speeds.

@171
Units used for horizontal distances e.g. range to waypoint, distance to go.

@172
Units used for vertical speeds (variometer)

@173
Units used for altitude and heights.

@174
Units used for task speeds.

@175
Units used for latitude and longitude.

@176
Pressure unit used for setting the QNH, hPA or INHg.

@177
The UTC offset field allows the UTC local time offset to be specified.  The local time is displayed below in order to make it easier to verify the correct offset has been entered.

@178
If ON, short clicking on the map will show the nearest waypoint's details.
If OFF, short clicking in the upper half area of the map will zoom in, in the lower part will zoom out.
Default is OFF  with Virtual Keys OFF as well, to get a faster click response..

@179
When enabled, the map screen is divided in three virtual parts. Pressing for about 1 second on the upper part will result in a UP key, in the lower part into a DOWN key, and in the middle part into an ENTER key.
These up down and enter keys may be applied to change IBOX values such as MC, destination waypoint in a task, etc. 
once an infobox has been selected in IBOX mode.
To select a waypoint on the map, do a quick click on it, as short as possible. 
Remember than longer clicks may be interpreted as a virtual key!
To select an airspace on the map, press for about half a second on it.
If you do an ENTER key on the map, you will invert text colors.
If you are NOT using active map, it is better not to enable virtual keys because zoom in in and out will require very short clicks.

@180
Gestures are always enabled in LK8000, but you can choose if you want them like on Iphone or inverted.
For example, a gesture from left to right is a TURN PAGE LEFT on Iphones and many other similar devices.
The same gesture otherwise will result in a TURN PAGE RIGHT.
Default is INVERTED, opposite to Iphone usage.

@181
If enabled, clicking on a navbox will lock the moving map preventing waypoint selection or zoom actions. Double click on the moving map (NOT on navboxes) will unlock the map.
This feature can be useful to PG and delta pilots, and by default it is OFF. 

@182
This determines how long menus will appear on screen if the user does not make any button presses or interacts with the computer.

@183
Defines the location of the glider drawn on the screen in percent from the bottom.

@184
Two styles are available: WinPilot style (green and purple circles) or a high visibility style.

@185
Choose how to display values for landable waypoints. With or without a box around, with or without units (meters, feet).

@186
Can show arrival altitude over safety, or required efficiency to arrive over safety.

@187
If ON, bottom bar and LK pages are white with black text. The overlay text color will be reversed, so if you have set black they will be white. You can reverse these colors with a custom key. DEFAULT IS OFF.

@188
Change the color of text on the screen: ALL BLACK will use black for all values and names, VALUES WHITE will show map values and air ports in outlined white style, and ALL WHITE will set outlined white for everything including outlandings and generic turnpoints..

@189
Choose the color of map overlays. Default is white, which becomes automatically black when reversed.  Some colors are reversable, some others are not. You may experiment with combinations. 

@190
LK Page 2.3 is listing nearest Turnpoints. Here you define what to list.
NO LANDABLES  will not include in this list all turnpoints that are also landable, and thus part of pages 2.1 or 2.2. This is the default setting.
ALL WAYPOINTS will include also landables that you already have listed in 2.1 and 2.2 .
DAT TURNPOINTS will include only waypoints that have a T flag. This is useful only for people using DAT waypoint files, since SeeYou CUP waypoints are all marked with a T flag.
This filter does not affect any other functionality. 

@191
Do not display units like Km, Ft, etc. in the infoboxes and in LK8000 mode.
Some low-resolution screens may require this setting to save some space, expecially 320x240 ones!

@192
Only Map related fonts and dialogues can be customized, if needed. PC version does not allow to change fonts.
LK specific fonts cannot be customized.

@193
Draw overlay values on moving map.
Half mode will paint destination waypoint and distance on upper left, and more informations on the right (MC, requested efficiency and arrival altitude difference for gliders).
Full mode will also paint clock and left values. See the manual.

@194
This determines whether the the glide terrain range is calculated and drawn as a line on the map area:
[OFF] Disables display
[Line] Draws a dashed line at the glide range
[Shade] Shades terrain outside glide range
When glide terrain is shown, a RED CROSS will appear if the current destination is reachable in terms of glide ratio, but unreachable because of an obstacle. 
The obstacle is indicated together with a boxed value, which is the altitude you need to gain to pass the obstacle. 
This altitude takes into account the terrain safety margin you have configured in safety menu.
NOTICE: Glide terrain SHADE is shown ONLY during flight. When on ground, it is NOT displayed.

@195
Glide bar can be relative to Task Finish or to the next turnpoint, or it can be disabled. This bar is drawn on the left side of the screen.
Value is calculated for current MC, being a task value: if you dont have a task but only a single goto, 
then this value may be different from overlay waypoint arrival, because this value is always calculated for current MC even below safetyMC. Landables will consider safety altitude as usual.

@196
The vario bar appears on the left of the screen. It is useful ONLY if you have a real vario connected, or a fast barometric altitude reading.

@197
A blue profile of thermals will appear during circling on the left upper part of the map. 

@198
Track line does not appear on low zoom levels. 

@199
This enables the display of FLARM traffic on the map window
[OFF] FLARM map display disabled
[ON/Fixed] FLARM map display enabled with fixed scale.
[ON/Scaled] FLARM map display enabled and auto scaled.
When auto scaling is enabled, the FLARM targets on the map display are scaled so that when the map is at large zoom levels, 
targets are still visible. 

@200
Determines how waypoints are advanced when flying the task.
[Manual] User must manually advance each waypoint.
[Auto] Waypoint automatically advances as soon as glider intercepts waypoint (cylinder,sector or line) including Start.
[Arm] User must manually Arm every waypoint before it will advance (including the Start). This option is RECOMMENDED for AAT tasks!
[Arm start] User must manually Arm the Start waypoint before the task will start. All other waypoints automatically advance.

@201
Type of the start.
[Line]: The task is started when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[Cylinder]: The task is started when the glider leaves the cylinder.  The cylinder radius is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[FAI Sector]: Defines a 90 degree sector.  The task is started when the glider crosses the sector lines.  
The radius of the sector is set via the 'Start radius' property.

@202
Radius of the start cylinder/sector or half-length of the start line.

@203
Type of sectors used for non-AAT tasks.
[Cylinder]  Barrel cylinder of specified radius.
[FAI sector]  90 degree sector centered at bisector at specified radius
[DAe 0.5/10] German national sector type, equivalent to 0.5 km radius barrel and 10 km FAI sector.

@204
Radius of the turnpoint observation area for non-AAT tasks.

@205
Type of the finish.
[Line]: The task is finished when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Finish radius' property.
[Cylinder]: The task is finished when the glider enters the cylinder.  The cylinder radius is set via the 'Finish radius' property.
[FAI Sector]: Defines a 90 degree sector.  The task is finished when the glider crosses the sector lines.  
The radius of the sector is set via the 'Finish radius' property.

@206
Radius of the finish cylinder or half length of the finish line.

@207
This determines whether the logger uses the short IGC file name or the long IGC file name.
Example short name (81HXABC1.IGC), long name (2008-01-18-XXX-ABC-01.IGC).

@208
Enables the automatic starting and stopping of logger on takeoff and landing respectively.

@209
Select your PDA/PNA model to make full use of its hardware capabilities, if available in the list.

@210
This option, if enabled sets the clock of the computer to the GPS time once a fix is set.  
This is only necessary if your computer does not have a real-time clock with battery backup or your computer frequently runs out of battery power or otherwise loses time.

@211
WORKING ONLY FOR HP31X: Set automatic backlight for this device. Max brightness and no timeout if on external power, otherwise max brightneess and a 5 minutes timeout on batteries. After timeout screen blanks to save energy.

@212
On some devices only, Set maximum sound volume automatically.

@213
Enables more configuration pages with engineering options to be used by expert users only.
WARNING: changing some of these options will result in software problems, since some of them are NOT compatible with LK interface!
After enabling, exit configuration menu and then re-enter configuration menu to see new items.

@214
Set zoom level for circling. You can change it while circling zoomin in and out manually, 
and for the rest of the flight that setting will be kept. This is the default if you don't change it.

@215
Default cruise zoom. Lower values bring more zoom, higher values bring less zoom.

@216
A time gate is a fixed local time which virtually open the task start, just like for boats.
Set to 0 if you dont have a start time.
Set at least to 1 if your race has a start time.

@217
For task races with at least 1 time gate, set the start local time. If gate number is 0, this value will be ignored.

@218
For task races with at least 1 time gate, set the start local time. If gate number is 0, this value will be ignored.

@219
If you have more than 1 time gate, set the interval time IN MINUTES for the others.
If you have only 1 gate, closing at a certain time, set the time interval to that time difference.
If you have only 1 gate, and no closing time, set interval to a large value such as 480 minutes.

@220
Start IN (Exit): when the pilot leaves the sector or cylinder from inside to outside.
Start OUT (Enter): when the pilot is entering the start sector or cylinder from outside to inside.


@221
This is the minimum interval between the system recognising key presses. 
Set this to a low value for a more responsive user interface; if it is too low, then accidental multiple key presses can occur. 
Changing this value may affect virtual keys as well. CAUTION. 250ms is suggested.

@222
The Input Events file defines the menu system and how LK8000 responds to button presses and events from external devices.

@223
The language file defines translations for LK8000 text in English to
other languages.  If this field is left blank, then LK8000 uses English.

@224
The status file can be used to define sounds to be played when certain events occur, and how long various status messages will appear on screen.

@225
If enabled, the MacCready value currently set is shown on the right top of the map, under the compass.

@226
This is the time interval between logged points when not circling.

@227
This is the time interval between logged points when circling.

@228
Determines whether to draw window animations when dialogs open/close.

@229
If you want Visual Glide to display also moving circles or arcs, in addition to the steady mode then select Extended.

@230
Defines the alignment of the status message box, either centered or in the top left corner.

@231
Determines the way the wind arrow is drawn on the map.
[Arrow head] Draws an arrow head only
[Full arrow] Draws an arrow head with a dashed arrow line

@232
Geometry values range 0-7 but  only some of them are really available. 
ATTENTION: LK8000 only supports 5 boxes on the right if in landscape mode, and classic top and bottom lines if in portrait mode. 
If you use other geometries, the LK8000 will not work properly.

@233
The STF risk factor reduces the MacCready setting used to calculate speed to fly as the glider gets low, in order to compensate for risk. 
Set to 0.0 for no compensation, 1.0 scales Mc linearly with height.

@234
If enabled, the command speed in cruise is set to the MacCready speed to fly in no vertical air-mass movement. 
If disabled, the command speed in cruise is set to the dolphin speed to fly, equivalent to the MacCready speed with vertical air-mass movement.

@235
Determines how the user is prompted for text input (filename, teamcode etc.)

@236
This option defines how waypoints outside the terrain range are handled: the user can be asked when this occurs, 
or they can be always included or excluded.

@237
Show clock in full overlay mode

# BASIC SETTINGS
#

@300
Ballast of the glider.  Increase this value if the pilot/cockpit load is greater than the reference pilot weight of the glide polar 
(typically 75kg).  Press ENTER on this field to toggle count-down of the ballast volume according to the dump rate specified in the configuration settings.

@301
Wing loading for this glider. It depends on your weight, on additional equipments installed, etc. Ballast is accounted separately. 
You should set Wing Loading with no ballast first.
This value is NOT saved, and it is reset at each startup to the wing loading calculated for your polar. 
Normally, but not always, your polar has considered a 70kg weight pilot. If you are not sure, leave the default wing loading. 

@302
How clean the glider is. Set to 100% for clean, lower numbers as the wings pick up bugs or get wet.  50% indicates the glider's sink rate is doubled.

@303
ONLY for BARO ALTITUDE when available! IF no baro altitude, this config will do nothing!
this is the Area pressure for barometric altimeter calibration.  Some external vario will set it automatically, 
some other require your action. Changing QNH will set new barometric altitude accordingly. If you change altitude in the next box, QNH will be set accordingly too.
You normally set the correct altitude on ground, and set a new QNH while flying if an AFIS radio service will tell you the new QNH.
Again, this is about Barometric altitude, and if you don't have baro altitude fed to LK it will do nothing.
The standard pressure for the QNE altitude is 1013.2 . This is the default. If you don't understand what we are talking about, do not change the QNH.

@304
Change the baro altitude here. You need of course a baro altitude being fed to LK, otherwise this value will constantly be ZERO.
Changing baro altitude will set QNH accordingly, automatically.
If you want to set the QNE altitude, regulate the QNH to 1013.2 

@305
Set to forecast ground temperature.  Used by convection estimator (temperature trace page of Analysis dialog)

#
# CUSTOM KEYS
#

@400
Custom keys are obtained by clicking on the bottom bar for at least some time.
Below this time, the click will rotate as usual the LK8000 pages.
Here you define how long you must AT LEAST keep pressed in order to call up Custom key instead of normal page rotation.
This time is expressed in milliseconds, and it changes device by device so you may experiment yourself.
Default is 700ms, which is good for HP314 and other devices.
If no action is defined for any custom key, then this parameter is not used.
Top screen custom keys do not use this value because they are instantly selected.

@401
Custom TOP LEFT key is obtained by clicking on the top left corner of the screen.
See the manual for all combinations.  Default is Multitarget. 

@402
Custom TOP RIGHT key is obtained by clicking on the top right corner of the screen.
This key is NOT AVAILABLE FOR PARAGLIDERS, see the manual.
See the manual for all combinations.  Default is no action. 

@403
Custom LEFT key is obtained by clicking on the left corner of the bottom bar for at least some time.
Below this time, the click will rotate as usual the LK8000 bottombar stripes.

# LOGGER REPLAY
#

@450
Time acceleration of replay.
Set to 0 for pause, 1 for normal real-time replay. Over 10x all calculations and statistics will be wrong: 
good only for a fast forward to a certain flight point. 

#
# TARGET
#

@460
This sets the task point for review.

@461
For AAT tasks, this setting can be used to adjust the target points within the AAT sectors.  
Larger values move the target points to produce larger task distances, 
smaller values move the target points to produce smaller task distances.

@462
For AAT tasks, this setting can be used to adjust the target points within the AAT sectors.  Positive values rotate the range line c
lockwise, negative values rotate the range line counterclockwise.

@463
When enabled, targets placed within the AAT area are not adjusted automatically.

# TASK CALCULATOR
#

@480
Adjusts Mc value used in the calculator.  Use this to determine the effect on estimated task time due to changes in conditions.
This value will not affect the main computer's setting if the dialog is exited with the Cancel button.

@481
For AAT tasks, this setting can be used to adjust the target points within the AAT sectors.
Larger values move the target points to produce larger task distances, 
smaller values move the target points to produce smaller task distances.

@482
Efficiency of cruise.  100 indicates perfect MacCready performance, greater than 100 indicates better than MacCready performance is
achieved through flying in streets.  
Less than 100 is appropriate if you fly considerably off-track.  
Pressing ENTER on this dialog will estimate the cruise efficiency according to the current flight history with the set Mc value.

# TASK RULES
#

@490
Maximum speed allowed in start observation zone.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@491
Maximum height while starting the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@492
Reference used for start max height rule
[MSL] Reference is altitude above mean sea level
[AGL] Reference is the height above the start point

@493
Minimum height above ground while finishing the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@494
If enabled, this option requires the minimum height above ground for finish to be greater than 1000m below the start height.

@495
Enables OLC tasks.  When enabled, OLC style task start is detected automatically (lowest point of flight after initial climb). 
Auto MacCready in final glide sets MacCready to obtain greatest distance in remaining height and time for OLC sprint tasks.

@496
Rules used for calculating optimal points for OnLine Contest.
[Sprint]: Conforms to FAI IGC League rules.  Up to 5 points including start and finish, maximum duration 2.5 hours, finish height must not be below start height.
[Triangle]: Conforms to FAI OLC triangle rules.  
Four points with common start and finish.  
For tasks longer than 500km, no leg less than
25% or larger than 45%; otherwise no leg less than 28% of total.  
Finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.
[Classic]: Conforms to OLC classic rules.  Up to seven points including start and finish, 
finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.  
Points awarded 80% on second last leg and 60% on last leg.

# TASK WAYPOINTS
#

@500
Type of the start.
[Line]: The task is started when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[Cylinder]: The task is started when the glider leaves the cylinder.  The cylinder radius is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[FAI Sector]: Defines a 90 degree sector.  The task is started when the glider crosses the sector lines.  The radius of the sector is set via the 'Start radius' property.

@501
Radius of the start cylinder/sector or half-length of the start line.

@502
Enables alternate start points.

@503
Enables AAT tasks.  When enabled, the AAT observation parameters can be set for each turnpoint.

@504
Minimum AAT task time in minutes.

@505
Type of sectors used for non-AAT tasks.
[Cylinder]  Barrel cylinder of specified radius.
[FAI sector]  90 degree sector centered at bisector, at specified range
[DAe 0.5/10] German national sector type, equivalent to 0.5 km radius barrel and 10 km FAI sector.

@506
Radius of the turnpoint observation area for non-AAT tasks.

@507
Determines how waypoints are advanced through the task.
[Manual] Fully manual task waypoint advancing
[Auto] Fully automatic task waypoint advancing
[Arm] Automatic task waypoint advancing needs to be armed each waypoint
[Arm start] Automatic task waypoint advancing needs to be armed for the start

@508
Type of the AAT observation area:
[Cylinder]: Defines a cylindrical AAT area, radius is defined by the 'Circle radius' properties.
[Sector]: Defines a sector AAT area, radius is defined by the 'Sector radius' parameter, and the sector is bounded by the 'Start radial' and 'End radial' properties.

@509
Radius of the AAT observation area for cylindrical type.

@510
Radius of the AAT observation area for sector type.

@511
Start radial of the AAT observation area for sector type.

@512
Finish radial of the AAT observation area for sector type.

@513
Type of the finish.
[Line]: The task is finished when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Finish radius' property.
[Cylinder]: The task is finished when the glider enters the cylinder.  The cylinder radius is set via the 'Finish radius' property.
[FAI Sector]: Defines a 90 degree sector.  The task is finished when the glider crosses the sector lines.  The radius of the sector is set via the 'Finish radius' property.

# TIME GATES
#

@530
A time gate is a fixed local time which virtually open the task start, just like for boats.
Set to 0 if you dont have a start time.
Set at least to 1 if your race has a start time.
TIME GATES WORK ONLY FOR PARAGLIDERS AND DELTA MODE 

@531
For task races with at least 1 time gate, set the start local time. If gate number is 0, this value will be ignored.

@532
If you have more than 1 time gate, set the interval time IN MINUTES for the others.
If you have only 1 gate, closing at a certain time, set the time interval to that time difference.
If you have only 1 gate, and no closing time, set interval to a large value such as 480 minutes.

@533
Start IN (Exit): when the pilot leaves the sector or cylinder from inside to outside.
Start OUT (Enter): when the pilot is entering the start sector or cylinder from outside to inside.

# OTHER
#

@600
Display water labels for lakes and rivers only below the chosen scale value. Set 0 for no labels.

@601
Display labels for this category only below the chosen scale value. Set 0 for no labels.

@602
Display labels for this category only below the chosen scale value. Set 0 for no labels.
If you are not using an enhanced topology, which may not be available for your areas,
then this box will be painted blue and you will not be able to choose a value.

@610
Manual adjustment of wind speed.

@611
Manual adjustment of wind direction.

@612
This allows switching on or off the automatic wind algorithm.  
When the algorithm is switched off, the pilot is responsible for setting the wind estimate.
[Circling] Requires only a GPS source
[ZigZag] requires an intelligent vario with airspeed output.
[Both] Use ZigZag and circling.

@613
Determines whether the snail trail is drifted with the wind when displayed in circling mode.
